# tinderbox

## Goal

The goal is to detect build issues of and conflicts between Gentoo Linux packages.

For that a dozen sandbox'ed Gentoo images are running in parallel.

Each image is setup from a recent _stage3_ tarball as an arbitrary combination of _~amd64_ + _profile_ + _USE flag_ set.
Within each image all Gentoo packages are scheduled in a randomized order to be emerged.

## Usage

Setup an image with _replace_img.sh_ or directly with _setup_img.sh_.
See the status of all images:

```bash
whatsup.sh -decp
whatsup.sh -otl
```

The file _~tinderbox/tb/data/ALREADY_CAUGHT_ holds reported findings.
A new finding is send via email to the user specified by the variable _MAILTO_.
The Gentoo bugzilla can be searched (again) by _check_bgo.sh_ for dups/similarities.
A finding can be filed using _bgo.sh_.

## Installation

Create the user _tinderbox_:

```bash
useradd -m tinderbox
usermod -a -G portage tinderbox
```

Run as _root_:

```bash
mkdir /opt/tb
chmod 750 /opt/tb
chgrp tinderbox /opt/tb
```

Run as user _tinderbox_ in _~tinderbox_ :

```bash
mkdir distfiles img logs run tb
```

Clone this Git repository.

Move _./data_ and _./sdata_ into _~tinderbox/tb/_.
Move _./bin_ under _/opt/tb/_ as user _root_.
The user _tinderbox_ must not be allowed to edit the scripts in _/opt/tb/bin_.
The user _tinderbox_ must have write permissions for files in _~tinderbox/tb/data_.
Edit the ssmtp credentials in _~tinderbox/sdata_ and strip away the suffix _.sample_,
set ownership and grant permissions of this subdirectory and its files to user _root_ only.
Grant the user _tinderbox_ these sudo rights:

```bash
tinderbox  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/tb/bin/bwrap.sh,/opt/tb/bin/setup_img.sh,/opt/tb/bin/house_keeping.sh
```

Create crontab entries for user _tinderbox_:

```bash
# crontab of tinderbox
#

# start web service
@reboot   cd ~/img && nice /opt/fuzz-utils/simple-http-server.py --address x.y.z --port 12345 &>/tmp/web-tinderbox.log

# start images
@reboot   rm -f ~tinderbox/run/*/var/tmp/tb/STOP; /opt/tb/bin/start_img.sh

# check logs
@reboot   while :; do sleep 60; /opt/tb/bin/logcheck.sh; done

# run 13 images in parallel
@hourly   f=$(mktemp /tmp/XXXXXX); /opt/tb/bin/replace_img.sh -n 13 &>$f; cat $f; rm $f

# house keeping
@daily    sudo /opt/tb/bin/house_keeping.sh
```

and this as _root_ (because the _local_ cgroup is used by other users too):

```bash
@reboot   /opt/tb/bin/cgroup.sh
```
